                <p>I build interactive web sites and I teach web-based graphic design and programming at all age levels. I'm based in Denver, Colorado, but I work with both students and clients in-person statewide and nationally online.</p>

                <p>As a graphic designer and web developer, I can provide you with any services you require from effective small business web sites to unique interactive experiences. Feel free to drop me a message and I'll be happy to discuss your needs.</p>

                <p>If you are interested in learning the skills that I apply to professional web projects, I'll be happy to work with you in-person or online through my different teaching opprotunities. Although I'm often teaching code focusing on web development, I focus much of the production work to take into consideration typography, color, navigation, user interaction, and overall style and I'm happy to tailor these options to your needs.</p>

                <p><b><i>Note:</i></b> This website was originally built in 2006. Whoa! Good design tends to stick around and much of my professional work over the last decade still isn't in here.

                    <br />I'm in the middle of updating these blog articles as I've been developing instructor-led classes thoughout Colorado. I'll be updating this content in the near future - at this moment, these links do not work.</p>
                <p>Most of my blog articles aim to inspire students who are overwhelmed trying to find the balance between school and life, like my post "<a href="#">Parents in College</a>."</p>
                <!--/parents-in-college-->

                <p>Many of my articles have become an easy reference for myself when teaching. You may be surprised how often my college students contact me by email with their use of poor grammar and spelling where I need the Little Orphan Annie Decoder Ring to decipher them. I've found it easier to initiate a discussion with them about this subject by emailing them a link to my blog article &quot;<a href="#">Importance of Good Grammar</a>&quot; and asking them what they think. I usually get a more positive response from them and a kind apology. </p>
