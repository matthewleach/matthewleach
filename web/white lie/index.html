<h1>A White Lie</h1>

<p>“December 25th.”</p>

<p>“Hey, your birthday is on Christmas?!?”</p>

<p>“Yep, every year.”</p>

<p>“So, do you get cheated out of presents or what?”</p>

<p>“Not so much as cheated as much as overlooked. Ya know, Merry Christmas ya-da, ya-da, ya-da…oh ya, it’s Matt’s birthday too.”</p>

<p>“Wow, I’d never want to be born on or near a holiday.”</p>

<p>“Yea, it’s funny. My father was born on April 1st–April Fool’s Day and my mother was born two days before Halloween…though my sister, on the other hand, was born on July 25. The middle of summer nowhere near any holidays.”</p>

<p>“If I had a choice of having my birthday on one of those dates, I would definitely have taken your sister’s…in the summer and and it’s perfect for pre-school shopping.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, though my sister took it hard for not being able to have people associate her birthday with a holiday. She’s always tried to please us. Always begging for attention. Doing anything. First she tried being good at stuff. Good in school. Good in sports. When that didn’t work, she tried being bad at stuff. Shoplifting. Drugs. Tattoos. Pierced nose. Grand theft auto. You know? Nothing seemed to work though. I guess that’s when she decided to kill herself.”</p>

<p>“You’re kidding, right?”</p>

<p>That’s when I smiled. </p>
