                <p>As a result of being an educator for over the last decade, I have a number of unique skill sets that I can help you in terms of training, design, and development. I can design and develop nearly any type of web project you need from engaging web sites with blogs to ecommerce sites.</p>

                <p>If you are interested in learning how to do this yourself, I can help you with that as well. I provide training on any of these subject matters and with my experience of teaching with online schools, I can provide online classroom experiences where we can work together one-on-one or within small groups.</p>

                <p>Because each job can be so vastly different I can't quote rates here. The more I understand about your needs, the more I can provide you an estimate for the costs. I tend to have a lot of freedom in coming up with creative ways of working with you, so let me know what you need and I'll be happy to help.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I can help anyone learn and improve their level of proficiency with both design and web-based programming. I love helping designers build a strong foundation with type, color, layout, and navigation and then helping them create their own unique presentation style. I can help in both one-on-one tutoring sessions, small group, as well as within an online classroom with your university.</p>

                <p>I can create any web site you need. We can discuss your needs and I can provide you with a number of possible solutions and their costs. When working with me, you'll have direct contact with me because I've found one-on-one communication makes project development much more efficient. Let me know what you are looking for and how I can help!</p>

                <p>I've developed over 30 collegiate courses both on-campus and online since 2001.

                <p>I've written three digital textbooks with Wynn Press and they have been adopted by 2 online schools and 7 campus schools. If you have an idea for a book and would like to discuss how to bring your textbook to the masses with text, videos, and interactive elements, I can design and develop your concepts fast and efficiently. If you are interested, I can help you learn and build your own interactive eBook, as well. </p>

                <p>I can build nearly any CMS (Content Management System) to give you full control over the maintenance and updates of your own web site. Blogs have become a very important feature of web sites to communicate with online users. Blogs also demonstrate your involvement with your web sites and create more engaging techniques of communicating with your users.</p>

I can also apply my audio to video screen capture tutorials and Adobe Flash animations as well.</p>
